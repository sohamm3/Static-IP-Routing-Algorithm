# Static-IP-Routing using Data Structures in C

This project can be used to specify the route's destination address and the next-hop router's IP address or routing switch interface through which the routing switch can reach the destination. Also, it is used for finding the shortest path from the user device to all local routers involved in that network to the user via Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

Data Structures used:
For Network Representation : Graph and Heap

For Devices Representation : Linked List and Trie
